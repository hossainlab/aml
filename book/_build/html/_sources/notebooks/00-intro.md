# About NumPy

## What is NumPy?

`NumPy` is a Python package which stands for ‘Numerical Python’. It is the core library for scientific computing, which contains a powerful n-dimensional array object, provide tools for integrating C, C++ etc. It is also useful in linear algebra, random number capability etc. NumPy array can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container for generic data. Now, let me tell you what exactly is a python numpy array.

## Keypoints
- Numpy stands for numerical Python
- Fundamental package for numerical computations in Python
- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated (broadcasting) functions
- tools for integrating C/C++ and Fortran code
- useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

## NumPy Array
Numpy array is a powerful N-dimensional array object which is in the form of rows and columns. We can initialize numpy arrays from nested Python lists and access it elements. In order to perform these numpy operations.

## N-dimensional Array
- 1Dimensional(1D) Array
- 2Dimensional(2D) Array
- 3Dimensional(3D) Array
